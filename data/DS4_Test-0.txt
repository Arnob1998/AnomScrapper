0,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great value,"







  
  
    This is the second 128GB SD card I purchased. The first one lasted almost three years and now had to be replaced due to errors. I have had other sizes and they have been fine. Generally this brand has been a good value.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Macbook Pro 14 SD Slot - Actual Speeds,"







  
  
    For those of you that want to use this in a M1 MacBook Pro 14 SD slot, here are the speed numbers that you can probably expect with a generic adapter:SanDisk 1TB Ultra (SDSQUA4-1T00-GN6MA):  Write: 22.6 MB/s & Read: 79.2 MB/sThese values vary slightly depending on size of files used on the tests.  (See my photo)Note that this card advertises that you can get Read speeds of 120 MB/s.  However, keep in mind that those speeds are under ideal conditions and using SanDisk’s own reader that uses a proprietary protocol to achieve that.Realistically, most of us will be using the UHS-I speed of our hardware.  In my case on the MBP14, that is 104MB/s for the slot.  Without the proprietary Sandisk hardware the speeds are lower and you will most likely see speeds closer to what I have above — so temper your expectations and buy accordingly.

    Since I’ve started scanning my entire library into PDF, I quickly ran out of room on the internal Kindle memory. This was the largest SD card I could find. It took a couple of seconds to insert and format. I now have what used to be hundreds of pounds of books and magazines stored on this little wafer the size of a postage stamp.
